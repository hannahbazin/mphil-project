In this vignette, I compare healthy and obese snRNA-seq data from human perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). The two samples are taken from an original collection of three samples. We are only interested in two patients in this analysis:

-   Patient 1: 65 years old, BMI of 23.5 (healthy weight)
-   Patient 3: 61 years old, BMI of 35.3 (obese)

There are 12,657 and 6,456 cells in samples 1 and 3 respectively that were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The raw data can be found on the Gene Expression Omnibus website [at this link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164528).

# Set up

## Set working directory

The working directory can be set by running the following command in the terminal: `setwd("/Users/hannahbazin/Desktop/Cambridge/Academics/Han_Lab/MPhil/mphil-project")`

## Set seed

Because `pathfindR` includes a heuristic search algorithm to identify active subnetworks, we set a random seed for reproducibility.

```{r}

# Set random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

```

## Load libraries

```{r}

library(GEOquery)
library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyverse)
library(pathfindR)

```

# Seurat analysis

## Load data

For consistency we reload the integrated Seurat object generated previously in the notebook titled `human_PVAT_snRNAseq.Rmd`.

```{r}

# Load integrated Seurat object from previous analysis
load(file = "data/analysis/anno_combined.RData")

# Subset to samples 1 and 3
healthy <- subset(anno_combined, subset = sampleType == "GSM5068996")
obese <- subset(anno_combined, subset = sampleType == "GSM5068998")

```

## Visualise UMAPs

```{r}

# Plot UMAP per sample
healthy_umap <- DimPlot(healthy, reduction = "umap") + ggtitle("Healthy Sample")
obese_umap <- DimPlot(obese, reduction = "umap") + ggtitle("Obese Sample")

# Save plots
pdf("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/UMAP_healthy.pdf", width = 12, height = 6)
print(healthy_umap)
invisible(dev.off())

pdf("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/UMAP_obese.pdf", width = 12, height = 6)
print(obese_umap)
invisible(dev.off())

# Show plot
healthy_umap
obese_umap

```

## Scale data

Subsetting a Seurat object may cause the loss of the scaled data in the object. We verify this and recompute the scaled data for both patients. This is a time-consuming step, so it is best to save the R objects.


```{r}

# Ensure default assay is RNA assay
DefaultAssay(healthy) <- "RNA"
DefaultAssay(obese) <- "RNA"

# Check that scaled data was preserved - this can be lost while subsetting
head(healthy@assays$RNA@scale.data) # NOT OK
head(obese@assays$RNA@scale.data) # NOT OK

# Scale data for each subset separately - if needed
  # This is a time-consuming step, save the object
if (file.exists("data/analysis/healthy_scaled.RData")) {
  
  message("Loading existing healthy scaled data file.")
  
  load(file = "data/analysis/healthy_scaled.RData")
  
} else {
  
  message("Missing healthy scaled data file. Scaling data now.")
  
  healthy_scaled <- ScaleData(healthy, vars.to.regress = "percent.mt")
  
  save(healthy_scaled, file = "data/analysis/healthy_scaled.RData")

}

if (file.exists("data/analysis/obese_scaled.RData")) {
  
  message("Loading existing obese scaled data file.")
  
  load(file = "data/analysis/obese_scaled.RData")
  
} else {
  
  message("Missing obese scaled data file. Scaling data now.")
  
  obese_scaled <- ScaleData(obese, vars.to.regress = "percent.mt")
  
  save(obese_scaled, file = "data/analysis/obese_scaled.RData")

}

```

## Find markers

The `FindAllMarkers()` function finds markers (i.e. differentially expressed genes) for each of the clusters in a dataset. By default, it uses a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to identify differentially expressed genes between two groups.Because the function compares one cluster with all other clusters - including non-adipocytes ones, meaning it may identify pathways reflecting differences between adipocytes and non-adipocytes rather than differences between adipocyte developmental stages.

For this reason, we use the `FindMarkers` function instead. This function finds differentially expressed genes in adipocyte clusters by comparing them only to the three other adipocyte clusters. Seurat will combine all the clusters in `ident.2` into a single reference group.

The parameters are set as follows:
- `min.pct = 0.3` only tests genes detected in 30% of either of the two populations being compared. This speeds up the function and allows us to focus on more biologically relevant genes.
- `logfc.threshold = 0.3` limits testing to genes that show at least 0.3-fold difference (log-scale) between the two groups (removes weaker signals).


```{r}

# Select clusters in adipocyte lineage
adipo_clusters <- c("Early pre-adipocytes", "Intermediate pre-adipocytes", "Transitional adipocytes", "Mature adipocytes")

healthy_adipo <- subset(healthy_scaled, idents = adipo_clusters)
obese_adipo <- subset(obese_scaled, idents = adipo_clusters)

# Define marker file paths
healthy_marker_files <- paste0("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/healthy_markers_", gsub(" ", "_", tolower(adipo_clusters)), ".csv")
obese_marker_files <- paste0("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/obese_markers_", gsub(" ", "_", tolower(adipo_clusters)), ".csv")

# Function to run FindMarkers for each cluster
run_find_markers <- function(object, condition, marker_files) {
  
  # Identify missing files
  missing_files <- marker_files[!file.exists(marker_files)]
  
  if (length(missing_files) > 0) {
    message("Missing marker files: ", paste(missing_files, collapse=", "))
  }
  
  # Only run FindMarkers if any marker file is missing
  if (!all(file.exists(marker_files))) {
    
    for (cluster in adipo_clusters) {
      
      markers <- FindMarkers(
        object = object,
        ident.1 = cluster,
        ident.2 = setdiff(adipo_clusters, cluster),
        min.pct = 0.3, # Min fraction of cells expressing the genes
        logfc.threshold = 0.3, # Min log fold change
        verbose = TRUE
      )
      
      # Save CSV
      marker_file <- paste0("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/", condition, "_markers_", gsub(" ", "_", tolower(cluster)), ".csv")
      write.csv(markers, marker_file, row.names = TRUE)
      message(paste0("Saved markers for ", condition, " - ", cluster, " to ", marker_file))
    }
  
  } else {
    
    message(paste0("All marker files already exist for ", condition, ". Skipping FindMarkers()."))
    
  }
}

# Ensure default assay is RNA assay
DefaultAssay(healthy_adipo) <- "RNA"
DefaultAssay(obese_adipo) <- "RNA"

# Run FindMarkers for healthy and obese
run_find_markers(healthy_adipo, "healthy", healthy_marker_files)
run_find_markers(obese_adipo, "obese", obese_marker_files)

```

# Cluster fractions

We can compute the fraction of cells within the adipocyte lineage part of each differentiation step.

```{r}

# Function to calculate cluster percentages of adipocyte lineage
get_cluster_percentages <- function(seurat_obj) {
  subset_ident <- seurat_obj@active.ident[seurat_obj@active.ident %in% adipo_clusters]  # Filter only relevant clusters
  total_cells <- length(subset_ident)
  percentages <- sapply(adipo_clusters, function(cluster) (sum(subset_ident == cluster) / total_cells) * 100)
  return(percentages)
}

# Compute percentages for both Seurat objects
healthy_percentages <- get_cluster_percentages(healthy)
obese_percentages <- get_cluster_percentages(obese)

# Create final dataframe
result_df <- data.frame(
  Cluster = adipo_clusters,
  Healthy = healthy_percentages,
  Obese = obese_percentages
)

# Save as CSV
write.csv(result_df, "results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/cluster_percentages.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Print dataframe
result_df

```


# `pathfindR` analysis

`pathfindR` is an R package designed for active-subnetwork-oriented pathway enrichment analysis. Unlike traditional over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which evaluate gene lists without considering gene interactions, pathfindR integrates protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) to identify active subnetworks – groups of interacting genes enriched in significantly altered genes. A subnetwork is defined as a cluster of interconnected genes in a PIN, and it is considered active if it contains a disproportionately high number of differentially expressed genes. The algorithm then performs pathway enrichment analysis on these subnetworks to identify biologically relevant pathways.

The `pathfindR` workflow consists of the following steps:

1.  **Mapping input genes** and their p-values onto a predefined PIN.
2.  **Identification of active subnetworks**, using a heuristic search algorithm to detect interconnected gene clusters enriched in significant genes.
3.  **Filtering subnetworks** based on predefined scoring criteria, including (i) the number of significant genes (minimum of 3 by default) and (ii) the subnetwork score, calculated as the sum of absolute log-transformed p-values of significant genes.
4.  **Pathway enrichment analysis** on selected subnetworks using Fisher’s Exact Test, with multiple testing correction using the Bonferroni method by default.
5.  **Iterative analysis**, where the active subnetwork search and enrichment steps are repeated multiple times to account for random variation in subnetwork detection, ensuring robustness by identifying pathways that remain significantly enriched across multiple runs.
6.  **Output generation**, producing a structured data frame of significantly enriched pathways and gene sets, along with key metrics such as the lowest and highest adjusted p-values across iterations, to assess the reproducibility of pathway enrichment across iterations.


## Load marker files

Load marker files for healthy patient.

```{r}

if (all(file.exists(healthy_marker_files))) {
  
  h_early <- read_csv(healthy_marker_files[1])
  h_intermediate <- read_csv(healthy_marker_files[2])
  h_transitional <- read_csv(healthy_marker_files[3])
  h_mature <- read_csv(healthy_marker_files[4])
  
} else {
  
  stop("One or more healthy marker files are missing. Run FindMarkers first.")
  
}

```

Load marker files for obese patient.

```{r}

if (all(file.exists(obese_marker_files))) {
  
  o_early <- read_csv(obese_marker_files[1])
  o_intermediate <- read_csv(obese_marker_files[2])
  o_transitional <- read_csv(obese_marker_files[3])
  o_mature <- read_csv(obese_marker_files[4])
  
} else {
  
  stop("One or more obese marker files are missing. Run FindMarkers first.")
  
}

```


## Reformat data

The data needs to be reformatted to align with the expected input of `pathfindR`. The input data frame must consist of columns containing: gene symbols, change values (optional) and p values.

```{r}

# Make function to reformat to pathfindR input
reformat_pathfindR <- function(input) {
  
  input %>%
    select(Gene.symbol = ...1, logFC = avg_log2FC, adj.P.Val = p_val_adj) %>% 
    as.data.frame()

}

# Reformat healthy markers
h_early <- reformat_pathfindR(h_early)
h_intermediate <- reformat_pathfindR(h_intermediate)
h_transitional <- reformat_pathfindR(h_transitional)
h_mature <- reformat_pathfindR(h_mature)

# Reformat obese markers
o_early <- reformat_pathfindR(o_early)
o_intermediate <- reformat_pathfindR(o_intermediate)
o_transitional <- reformat_pathfindR(o_transitional)
o_mature <- reformat_pathfindR(o_mature)

```


## Run `pathfindR`

### For healthy patient

For early pre-adipocytes

```{r}

h_early_output <- run_pathfindR(h_early,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )

```

For intermediate pre-adipocytes

```{r}

h_inter_output <- run_pathfindR(h_intermediate,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )

```

For transitional adipocytes

```{r}

h_trans_output <- run_pathfindR(h_transitional,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )
```

For mature adipocytes

```{r}

h_mature_output <- run_pathfindR(h_mature,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )

```

### For obese patient

For early preadipocytes

```{r}

o_early_output <- run_pathfindR(o_early,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )

```

For intermediate pre-adipocytes

```{r}

o_inter_output <- run_pathfindR(o_intermediate,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )

```

For transitional adipocytes, the analysis is not possible because the obese patient does not have enough of these cells, therefore no conclusions can be drawn.

For mature adipocytes

```{r}

o_mature_output <- run_pathfindR(o_mature,
                                gene_sets = "GO-BP",
                                min_gset_size = 5,
                                max_gset_size = 300
                                )

```



## Compare `pathfindR` results

The `pathfindR` package provides a function to compare two different `pathfindR` output dataframes. More details can be found in [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pathfindR/vignettes/comparing_results.html).


For early-pre-adipocytes

```{r}

# Combine results
combined_early <- combine_pathfindR_results(
  result_A = h_early_output,
  result_B = o_early_output
)

```

For intermediate pre-adipocytes

```{r}

# Combine results
combined_intermediate <- combine_pathfindR_results(
  result_A = h_inter_output,
  result_B = o_inter_output
)

```


For transitional adipocytes, the comparison is not possible because the obese patient does not show a sufficient quantity of transitional adipocyte cells, therefore no conclusions can be drawn.


For mature adipocytes

```{r}

# Combine results
combined_mature <- combine_pathfindR_results(
  result_A = h_mature_output,
  result_B = o_mature_output
)

```

## Save files

We save the files to streamline the workflow, allowing for quick access when rerunning only the visualisation chunks. In the resulting dataframes, "A only" represents pathways exclusive to the healthy group, while "B only" corresponds to pathways unique to the obese group.

```{r}

write.csv(combined_early, "results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/early_pre_healthy_vs_obese.csv", row.names = TRUE)

write.csv(combined_intermediate, "results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/intermediate_pre_healthy_vs_obese.csv", row.names = TRUE)

write.csv(combined_mature, "results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/mature_healthy_vs_obese.csv", row.names = TRUE)

```


## Generate bar plots

Load data and list patient conditions.

```{r}

# Load data
early_df <- read_csv("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/early_pre_healthy_vs_obese.csv")
intermediate_df <- read_csv("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/intermediate_pre_healthy_vs_obese.csv")

mature_df <- read_csv("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/mature_healthy_vs_obese.csv")

# List of conditions
conditions <- c("A only", "B only", "common")

condition_labels <- list("A only" = "Healthy Only", "B only" = "Obese Only", "common" = "Both Healthy and Obese")

```

Define function to create and save bar plots.
- For the A only and B only pathways, we rank them based on fold enrichment.
- For the common pathways, we rank them based on the combined p-value; this helps identify pathways that are consistently significant in both datasets.

```{r}

create_and_save_bar_plot <- function(df, category, title_label, output_file) {
  
  # Define sorting column
  sorting_col <- ifelse(category == "common", "combined_p", paste0("Fold_Enrichment_", substr(category, 1, 1)))

  # Filter top 20 enriched pathways
  if(category == "common") {
    
    df_filtered <- df %>% 
      filter(status == category) %>%
      arrange(combined_p) %>%
      slice_head(n = 20)
    
  } else {
    
    df_filtered <- df %>% 
      filter(status == category) %>%
      arrange(desc(.data[[sorting_col]])) %>%
      slice_head(n = 20)
  }

  # Ensure factor levels are correctly ordered for plotting
  if(category == "common") {
    
     df_filtered <- df_filtered %>%
       mutate(Term_Description = factor(Term_Description,
                                        levels = Term_Description))
     
  } else {
    
    df_filtered <- df_filtered %>%
      mutate(Term_Description = factor(Term_Description, levels = rev(Term_Description)))

  }
  
  # Create bar plot
  plot <- ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x = .data[[sorting_col]], y = Term_Description, fill = Term_Description)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black") +
    labs(title = title_label, x = ifelse(category == "common", "Combined P Value", "Fold Enrichment"),
         y = "Pathway") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
  
  # Save plot
  ggsave(output_file, plot, width = 12, height = 6, device = "pdf")

  # Return plot
  return(plot)
  
}

```

Generate plots for each differentiation stage: early pre-adipocytes, intermediate pre-adipocytes, and mature adipocytes.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

for (condition in conditions) {
  
  # Early adipocytes
  early_plot <- create_and_save_bar_plot(early_df, condition, paste("Early Pre-adipocytes: Enriched Pathways for", condition_labels[[condition]]), paste0("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/early_", gsub(" ", "_", condition), ".pdf"))
  
  print(early_plot)

  # Intermediate adipocytes
  inter_plot <- create_and_save_bar_plot(intermediate_df, condition, paste("Intermediate Pre-adipocytes: Enriched Pathways for", condition_labels[[condition]]), paste0("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/intermediate_", gsub(" ", "_", condition), ".pdf"))
  
  print(inter_plot)
  
  # Mature adipocytes
  mature_plot <- create_and_save_bar_plot(mature_df, condition, paste("Mature Adipocytes: Enriched Pathways for", condition_labels[[condition]]), paste0("results/humanPVATsn/pathfindR/comparison1v3/mature_", gsub(" ", "_", condition), ".pdf"))
  
  print(mature_plot)
  
}

```
